# Logo/Hex Sticker
The code in this repo creates our logo/hex sticker.
Part of the inspiration for creating a logo in R came from [this great post by Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/our-logo-in-r/).
We use the [hexSticker](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) package to create the hex sticker itself.
